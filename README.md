# HelpStarter

Version: 0.1.0

**[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)**

---

HelpStarter is a client-side mod for **Minecraft Forge 1.8.9**. It allows you to quickly fetch a list of available bots in-game via a command, and automatically invite a specified number of bots to your party.

The mod retrieves the bot list from a remote API and then runs the `/p <bot1> <bot2> ...` command in-game, making it easy to form a party quickly.
